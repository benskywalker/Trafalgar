# Trafagar - Napoleonic Europe revised.

Trafalgar is a revamp of Napoleonic Europe that aims to make a more balanced, dynamic, and historical campaign. 
Trafalgar has a focus on naval combat, with a buff to Ships of the Line and the addition of 4 new ships (Cutter, Sloop, Gunboat, and Raider).

I have added two new civs: Barbary Pirates and Egypt. Both have fun unique units and an interesting start.


Instructions:
Put Trafalgar.biq and the Trafalgar folder in your Conquests folder. Note that this is the *inner* Conquests folder. In my case it is:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete/Conquests/Conquests

Open civ 3, and press Conquests, then select Trafalgar. That's all! Please note: This scenario is still under development and may have gamebreaking bugs. I'm still working on patching them, but I can not guarantee your save will be safe. If I made a mistake in Custom Units, the save could become compromised with an error about Pedialcons. If you encounter this issue, please let me know immediately.

If you have difficulties, please message me at Reddit u/TaticusThrawn. I also welcome feedback and suggestions.
