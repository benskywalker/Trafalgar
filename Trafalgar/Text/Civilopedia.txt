#GAME_CONCEPTS

#GCON_Enslavement 
Enslavement
^
^
^Enslavement allows a unit to potentially "enslave" a combatant (instead of killing it) when it wins a battle. A unit with the "enslave" capability has a 1/3 chance of enslaving a deafeated unit everytime it wins a battle. As soon as the battle is over, the game determines if the defeated unit is enslaved; if so, the unit is turned into another unit type (as specificed in the editor) and is immediately under the control of the victorious player. 
^
^The $LINK<Privateer=PRTO_Privateer> and the British $LINK<Man-O-War=PRTO_Man-O-War> have the Enslavement capability. 


#GCON_Plants
Power Plants
^
^
^There are no [power plants] during the time of Napoleonic Europe -- and the people can breathe
easier becuase of it!


#GCON_Plague
Plague
^
^
^No outbreaks of the plague are expected to occur during play of this scenario.


#GCON_Air_Missions
Air Missions
^
^
^There are no air missions in Napoleonic Europe. Aircraft are still a century away...


#GCON_Barbarians
Barbarians
^
^
^Europe has no more barbarians by this time.

#GCON_ZOC
Zone of Control
^
^
^Some military units have a [zone of control] that influences the eight squares surrounding the unit. This represents the
unit's ability to project its combat power into surrounding areas. Such units attack enemies that enter the zone of control
without initiating a full battle.
^
^The following military units have a zone of control in the Napoleonic Europe scenario:
^* $LINK<Armies=PRTO_Army>
^* $LINK<Line Cavalry=PRTO_Cavalry>
^* $LINK<Prussian Cuirassiers=PRTO_Cuirassier>
^* $LINK<British Household Cavalry=PRTO_Household_Cavalry>
^* $LINK<Austrian Hussars=PRTO_Hussar>
^* $LINK<French Guard Cavalry=PRTO_Imperial_Cavalry>
^* $LINK<Ottoman Sipahi=PRTO_Sipahi>
^* $LINK<Russian Cossacks=PRTO_Cossack>
^* $LINK<French, Spanish, and Swedish Carabiniers=PRTO_Carabinier>
^* $LINK<Shock Cavalry=PRTO_Shock_Cavalry>


#GCON_Unit_Support
Supporting Military Units
^
^
^Generally, each military unit must be supported with one gold per turn from its $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>.
However, each form of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments> defers these costs for a certain number of units,
depending upon how many towns, cities, or metros the civilization controls.
^
^{Government			Town	City		Metro}
^Anarchy				  0		  0		  0
^Monarchy				  2		  4		  8
^Republic				  0		  0		  0


#GCON_Governments
Governments
^
^
^There are three forms of government that you can use to control your civilization.
Each has advantages and disadvantages. The type of government you use determines:
^
^How efficient your $LINK<workers=PRTO_Worker> are (how quickly they get their jobs done).
^How much $LINK<Corruption and Waste=GCON_Corruption> affects your civilization.
^The number of citizens you can $LINK<draft=GCON_Draft> per turn.
^The number of military units that can be used as $LINK<military police=GCON_Moods>.
^The number of military units you can have before you must $LINK<support=GCON_Unit_Support>
them from your $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>.
^
^The possible government types in this scenario are:
^* $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy>
^* $LINK<Monarchy=GOVT_Monarchy>
^* $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic>
^
^
^To change your form of government, you must have a $LINK<revolution=GCON_Revolution>.



#GCON_Draft
Draft
^
^ 
^When a civilization develops $LINK<Nationalism=TECH_Nationalism> its citizens can be drafted into
military service. Each city can draft some of its population each turn, depending upon the government currently in effect.
^* A civilization in $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy> may not use the draft.
^* A $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic> can draft [two] citizens per turn.
^* A $LINK<Monarchy=GOVT_Monarchy> can draft [two] citizens per turn.
^
^To utilize the draft, press the "Draft" button on the City Display. You may only draft citizens from a city with
^a population of 7 or higher.
^
^The draft produces the following $LINK<conscript=GCON_Experience> $LINK<Musketman=PRTO_Musketman>.
^
^However, drafting citizens will cause unhappiness in the city.



#GCON_Maintenance
Maintenance
^
^
^Some city improvements must be maintained after they are built. This [maintenance] cost
is paid from your $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury> once every turn.
^
^
^{These buildings require one gold per turn.}
^$LINK<Aqueduct=BLDG_Aqueduct>,
$LINK<Bank=BLDG_Bank>,
$LINK<Barracks=BLDG_Barracks>,

$LINK<Granary=BLDG_Granary>,
$LINK<Harbor=BLDG_Harbor>,
$LINK<Library=BLDG_Library>,

$LINK<Colosseum=BLDG_Colosseum>,
$LINK<Hospital=BLDG_Hospital>,
$LINK<Naval Academy=BLDG_Naval_Academy>,
$LINK<University=BLDG_University>.




#GCON_Combat
Combat
^
^
^There are only two types of combat in this scenario: ground/naval combat and bombardment.
^[Ground/Naval combat] occurs when units of different civilizations try to occupy the same square.
The two units trade blows until one of them loses its health bar and is destroyed.
The winner may be damaged (its health bar is reduced). 
^[Bombardment] occurs when a ranged unit, such as a cannon, attacks without entering the defender's square.
Bombardment inflicts losses to the defender's health bar but never completely destroys them.
Air bombardment is the same except the planes fly to the target and may be shot down on the way.
^
^{Repairing Damage}
^A unit that takes damage in combat but survives can heal, adding one $LINK<block=GCON_Experience> per turn back to
its health bar. To do so, it
^* must be in friendly or neutral territory.
^* must not move for a complete turn.
^
^{Repairing Faster}
^A city with a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks> heals ground units completely in one turn.
^A city with a $LINK<harbor=BLDG_Harbor> heals sea units completely in one turn.
^A civilization with $LINK<Battlefield Medicine=BLDG_Battlefield_Medicine> heals in enemy territory.



#GCON_Transport
Transport
^
^
^The $LINK<Troop Transport=PRTO_Galleon> (a naval unit) can carry or [transport] other units.
^
^The Troop Transport can be boarded from any shoreline
by simply moving the rider onto the ship. They may also be boarded from inside a coastal city by right-clicking
the unit in the garrison box and selecting from the menu, or using the Load command button when on the main map.


#GCON_Spaceship
Space Ship
^
There is no Space Ship building in Napoleonic Europe. The combustion engine has not even been invented yet!



#GCON_Victory
Victory Conditions
^
^ 
^There are three ways to win this scenario:
^
^
^{Domination}
^Have 66% of the world's land surface within your $LINK<borders=GCON_Territory> as well as 66% of the world's population
within your cities.
This can be accomplished either by military measures or by $LINK<cultural=GCON_Culture> development
(or, more likely, a combination of the two).
^
^
^{Victory Points}
^Be the first side to score 60,000 victory points.
^
^
^{High Score at End}
^Be the side with the highest score after time has run out. 

#DESC_GCON_Victory
^


#GCON_Maps
Maps
^
^
^{Fog of Intelligence}
^Since the start date of this scenario is 1800 AD, the game begins with the entire map known to all players.
Nevertheless, areas that are not currently "seen" by your people have a soft gray veil over them, revealing the
underlying terrain, but not all of the features (such as the presence or roads, irrigation, mines, etc.).
^
^So at any time, each and every square of the scenario map is either
^* explored				in grayness
^* seen				well lit
^
^
^{World Maps} As civilizations explore the world and found new cities, they gather information and create a map of
the world that is unique. For each civilization, it is comprised of the area its people currently see
and the explored areas (as they were when last seen). This is called the civilization's [world map] and
can be very valuable in negotiations with other, less knowledgeable, civilizations. You will be able to trade world
maps after your civilization discovers $LINK<Map Making=TECH_Map_Making>.
^
^
^{Territory Maps} Each civilization also keeps a [territory map] showing areas under its cultural influence only.
These are less valuable in negotiations, but still of some worth.



#GCON_Trade
Trade and Trade routes
^
^ 
^{Domestic Trade}
^Domestic trade occurs automatically between cities of the same civilization that are [connected] to each other.
Any tradable $LINK<resource=GCON_ResourcesN> within your territory that is connected to any city is shared
by [all] connected cities. Every city that is connected to a resource has that resource in the appropriate box of the
City Display.
^ 
^
^{Foreign Trade}
^A single resource icon is enough to supply the needs of an entire civilization. Excess resources may
be traded to other civilizations if the capital cities of both civilizations are connected. You trade
strategic and luxury resources with other civilizations during diplomatic negotiations.
^
^
^{Trade Route Connections}
Two cities are connected if any one of the following are true:
^* there is a $LINK<road=GCON_Worker_Jobs> running between them, or if
^* there are $LINK<harbors=BLDG_Harbor> in both cities and a visible water route between them.
^
^
^[Water Routes]: In order to use a water trade route, your civilization must be able to safely traverse
^every square of the route and this depends upon having
$LINK<Map Making=TECH_Map_Making>,
$LINK<Navigation=TECH_Navigation>, and/or
$LINK<Magnetism=TECH_Magnetism>.
^
^
^The only exception involves enemy territory: two cities are not connected if the only road that
connects them passes through enemy territory, or if a harbor is blockaded by enemy naval forces.


#GCON_ResourcesB
Bonus Resources
^
^
^[Bonus resources] are one of the types of $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN>. These
cannot be traded like $LINK<luxury=GCON_ResourcesL> or $LINK<strategic resources=GCON_ResourcesS>,
but do provide bonuses to worked squares within a $LINK<city radius=GCON_Radius>.
^
^
^{City Production Bonuses}
^A citizen laborer working a bonus resource square gains extra $LINK<food=GCON_Food>,
$LINK<shields=GCON_Shields>, and/or $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>.
^
^{Types		Food	Shields	Commerce}
^$LINK<Cattle=GOOD_Cattle>			+2		+1		+0
^$LINK<Fish=GOOD_Fish>			+2		+0		+1
^$LINK<Game=GOOD_Game>			+2		+0		+0
^$LINK<Gold=GOOD_Gold>			+0		+0		+4
^$LINK<Whales=GOOD_Whales>		+1		+1		+2
^$LINK<Wheat=GOOD_Wheat>		+2		+0		+0



#GCON_ResourcesN
Natural Resources
^
^
^In Napoleonic Europe there are 17 [natural resources] represented by various icons scattered around the world.
These fall into three categories, [Bonus, Luxury,] and [Strategic].
^
^
^[$LINK<Bonus Resources=GCON_ResourcesB>] give city production bonuses in worked squares within a city radius. Bonus resources
cannot be traded to other cities or civilizations. Bonus resources are always visible in $LINK<explored=GCON_Maps> areas of the map. 
^
^
^[$LINK<Luxury Resources=GCON_ResourcesL>] also give city production bonuses in squares worked by citizens.
But they may also be traded along trade routes, and make content people happy in cities that receive them. Luxury
resources are always visible on the map in explored areas.
^
^
^[$LINK<Strategic Resources=GCON_ResourcesS>], like both the others, give bonuses to city production, but, like luxuries they can also be traded.
Strategic resources are required for a city to build various military units and city improvements. Strategic resources 
appear on the map when a Civilization Advance exposes their usefulness.
^
^
^Luxury and Strategic Resources are referred to as {Tradable Resources.}



#GCON_ResourcesS
Strategic Resources
^
^
^[Strategic Resources] are one of the types of $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN>.
When available to a city from foreign or domestic $LINK<trade=GCON_Trade>, strategic resources enable the
construction of some units and city improvements.
^
^When a city "has" a strategic resource, it appears in the city's {Strategic Resource box}.
^
^
^{City Production Bonuses}
^Like all resources, strategic resources also provide city production bonuses to worked squares within a
$LINK<city radius=GCON_Radius>.
^
^{Types			Food	Shields	Commerce}
^$LINK<Horses=GOOD_Horses>			+0		+0		+1
^$LINK<Iron=GOOD_Iron>				+0		+1		+0
^$LINK<Saltpeter=GOOD_Saltpeter>			+0		+0		+1




#GCON_Armies
Armies
^
^
^An Army is actually a group of ordinary units that move and fight together. To form an army, you must build the Army unit
and then 'load' other units into it. You can load up to three units, though the $LINK<General Staff School=BLDG_Pentagon>
increases this limit to four, if you have built it.
^
^
^{Building an Army}
^Armies can be built in cities that have the $LINK<Military Academy=BLDG_Military_Academy>
or a $LINK<Leader=GCON_Leaders> in them. But you must have at least four cities for every army you create.
^
^
^{In Battle}
^An army uses one, some, or all its internal units to fight a battle, depending upon the course of the fight.
^
^{Spotting}
^An army can "see" up to two squares away, due to its intrinsic scouts.



#GCON_Corruption
Corruption and Waste
^
^
^[Corruption] is income lost to theft, embezzlement, and other illegal practices. [Waste] is shield production
lost to inefficiency. If left unchecked, corruption and waste will significantly slow the development of your
civilization. You can track the status of corruption and waste in your empire on the
[City Display] and [Domestic Advisor].
^
^
^{Causes}
^In general, the farther a city is from its capital city, the more corruption and waste it experiences. Also the more cities
in your empire, the higher rates of both, overall. Finally, the extent of corruption and waste is also affected by
the system of $LINK<government=MENU_Governments> you are currently using.
^
^
^{Solutions}
^A $LINK<courthouse=BLDG_Courthouse> or a nearby $LINK<Forbidden Palace=BLDG_Forbidden_Palace>
reduces corruption.
^
^Another solution, is to change your system of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments>. The more liberal the
government, the less corruption and waste you experience.
^
^Being attached to your capital via road or harbor also reduces corruption and waste.
^
^$LINK<We Love The ____ Day=GCON_We_Love_The_King_Day> also reduces waste.



#GCON_Hurry_Production
Hurry Production
^
^
^City construction projects (improvements or units) can be hurried to completion if necessary. 
Use the "Hurry" button on the [City Display].
^
^
^Under $LINK<Monarchy=GOVT_Monarchy> and $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic> you can pay overtime and hire temporary
workers to complete a project. This costs gold from your treasury; the amount depends upon how much work remains
to be done.
^
^
^$LINK<Great leaders=GCON_Leaders> can also be used to hurry production.
^
^
^You have [no] production if your civilization is in $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy>.


#GCON_Pollution
Pollution
^
^
^Pollution is a problem usually associated with the Industrial Age. In this scenario it is only caused by
large city populations.
^
^
^{Global Warming}
^If world pollution reaches sufficiently critical levels, there is a chance that global warming will occur.
It can cause forests and jungles to disappear, and grasslands to become plains, and plains to become desert.
World pollution is the sum of all city pollution, nuclear explosions, and meltdowns.
^
^
^Polluted areas can be cleaned up by $LINK<workers=GCON_Worker_Jobs>.



#GCON_Embassies
Embassies
^
^
^When a civilization learns $LINK<Writing=TECH_Writing>, it can begin to build its intelligence network.
The first step is to build [embassies] in rival capital cities. That done, you can sign Right of Passage
$LINK<agreements=GCON_Agreements> and Military Alliances against third parties.
^
^When your empire has developed a sense of $LINK<Diplomacy=TECH_Diplomacy>,
you can engage in $LINK<Mutual Protection Pacts=GCON_Agreements> and Trade Embargoes against third parties.
^
^Embassies cost gold from your treasury to build, and diplomatic missions cost gold to execute.
^
^Build an embassy by double-clicking the capital city icon after you have learned Writing.





#GCON_Worker_Jobs
Worker Actions

^
^{Build Barricade (Ctrl-F)}
^Turns Fortress into Barricade, doubling the square's $LINK<defensive value=GCON_Terrain_Combat>.
^
^{Build Colony (B)}
^$LINK<Colonies=GCON_Colony> are built atop $LINK<tradable resources=GCON_ResourcesN>. If $LINK<connected=GCON_Trade>
to a city, a [colony] provides the resource to that city.
^


#DESC_GCON_Worker_Jobs
^
^
^{Build Outpost (Ctrl-O)}
^$LINK<Outposts=GCON_Outposts> eliminate fog of war in neutral or owned territory. They can be built after the discovery
of $LINK<Masonry=TECH_Masonry>.
^
#GCON_Worker_Jobs_Advanced
Worker Actions (Advanced)
^ see also $LINK<Worker Actions=GCON_Worker_Jobs>
^
^
^{Road to (Ctrl-R)}
^Builds a road to a particular destination.
^
^{Build Road Then Colony (Ctrl-B)}
^The worker builds a road to a particular destination and then builds a $LINK<colony=GCON_Colony>
at the destination.
^
^{Automate (A)}
^Causes control of the worker to be relinquished while it performs automated tasks.
^
^{Automate: Build Trade Network (Ctrl-N)}
^Automates the worker, giving it the task of linking all cities to your capital city.
^
^{Automate: Irrigate to Nearest City (Ctrl-I)}
^Automates the worker, giving it the task of irrigating the nearest city.
^
^{Automate: Clear Forest (Shift-F)}
^Automates the worker, giving it the task of clearing all nearby forests.
^
^{Automate: Clear Wetlands (Shift-W)}
^Automates the worker, giving it the task of clearing all nearby jungle and/or marsh.
^
^{Automate: Clear Damage (Shift-D)}
^Automates the worker, giving it the task of clearing all nearby pollution, including $LINK<craters=GCON_Craters>.
^
^{Automate: This City Only (Shift-I)}
^Automates the worker, allowing it to perform automated tasks to improve the nearest city.



#GCON_Moods
Citizen moods
^
^
^Each citizen is either [happy, content], or [unhappy].
^
^{What Makes 'em Sad?}
^* $LINK<Overpopulation=GCON_Overpopulation>. 
^* $LINK<Forced labor=GCON_Hurry_Production>.
^* $LINK<Draft=GCON_Draft>.
^* $LINK<War weariness=GCON_War_Weariness>.
^
^{What Makes 'em Glad?}
^To combat unhappiness in your cities you can build improvements or take actions that produce
happy or content $LINK<faces=GCON_Happy_Faces>. Each happy face changes the mood of one citizen from content to happy; each
content face alters a citizen from unhappy to content.
^
^* Build a $LINK<temple=BLDG_Temple>, $LINK<colosseum=BLDG_Colosseum>, or $LINK<cathedral=BLDG_Cathedral>.
^* Bring assorted $LINK<luxuries=GCON_ResourcesL> into the city.
^* Convert some citizens to $LINK<entertainers=GCON_Specialists>.
^* Increase funding for entertainment using the Entertainment slider on the Domestic Advisor.
^* Garrison military units in the city (Military Police).
^
^A city in which more people are unhappy than happy falls into $LINK<civil disorder=GCON_Disorder>.
Content citizens and specialists are ignored.



#GCON_War_Weariness
War Weariness
^
^
^During times of war, citizens living under a $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic> 
become [war weary] and $LINK<unhappy=GCON_Moods> as a result.
^
^When [you] initiate the conflict your people will tolerate it for a while, but then may become quite unhappy.
When someone else declares the war, especially a traditional enemy, your people are more forgiving.
Carrying on a defensive war, that is keeping your troops at home, is more tolerable than offensive campaigns.
^
^The only way to end [war weariness] is to stop the war. You can use all your normal tricks to
$LINK<make 'em happier=GCON_Moods>, but the war weariness remains until the war stops.



#GCON_Research
Scientific Research
^
^
^Your civilization is constantly striving to learn about the world, science, invention, and creativity.
Its ability to succeed at these pursuits depends in large measure upon your allocation of revenue to science.
You set the allocation on the [Domestic Advisor] by sliding the science slider left or right to decrease
or increase (respectively) the amount of your tax revenue that you divert into research. By doing this,
you determine the percentage of each city's income that will be poured into research.
^
^At the start of each turn, the science output of each city is added to the research project currently
in progress, eventually resulting in the discovery of a new $LINK<Civilization Advance=MENU_Technologies>.
^
^To increase the science production in only one city, you can convert a citizen or two to a $LINK<scientist=GCON_Specialists>.
^
^Finally, the science output of individual cities -- and the empire overall, in some cases --
can be dramatically increased by building some improvements and wonders in those cities, such as:
^	$LINK<Libraries=BLDG_Library>
^	$LINK<Universities=BLDG_University>



#GCON_Specialists
Specialists
^
^
^It is sometimes necessary to fine-tune a city's production. To do so, you'll want specialists.
Specialists do not work in the city radius so they don't contribute to city production of food or commerce.
Instead, they produce extra happy faces, enhance scientific research, tax revenue, or shield production, or
help control corruption.
^
^
^{Entertainers}
^An entertainer produces one $LINK<happy face=GCON_Happy_Faces>.
^
^{Scientists}
^A scientist produces extra $LINK<scientific research=GCON_Research>.
^
^{Tax Collector}
^A tax collector produces extra $LINK<tax revenue=GCON_Commerce>.
^
^{Police Officers}
^Once $LINK<Nationalism=TECH_Nationalism> has been researched, a police officer can be used to help keep a
lid on $LINK<corruption=GCON_Corruption> in a city.
^

Outposts
^
^
^Outposts eliminate fog of war. To construct an Outpost, move a worker to any land tile in
neutral or owned territory and select the Build Outpost unit action. Construction of the
Outpost consumes the worker. The range of vision for the Outpost is 2 tiles on flat terrain,
3 on hills and 4 on mountains. Outposts can only be used by the player who created them. If
an Outpost falls within the territory of any other civilization, it will be destroyed. Outposts
can only be built in a tile that is empty, has a mine, irrigation or a road. You cannot build
an Outpost on a tile with a Colony. The "Build Outpost" unit-action becomes available after
the Masonry advance is researched.

An [Army] is a group of ordinary units that move and fight together. To form an army, you must build the Army unit
and then 'load' other units into it. You can load up to three units, though the $LINK<General Staff School=BLDG_Pentagon>
increases this limit to four, if you have built it.
^
^{Building an Army}
^Armies can be built in cities that have the $LINK<Military Academy=BLDG_Military_Academy>
or a $LINK<Leader=GCON_Leaders> in them. But you must have at least four cities for every army you create.

^
^As long as there have been soldiers, there have been military commanders that came by their position due to political
connections or perhaps their royal blood. Although many of these men performed ably in combat, quite a few
led their troops to disaster due to their personal lack of military insight. By the end of the 18th century many

^
^Napoleon is credited with the phrase, "An army marches on its stomach." One of his strengths as

best-clothed, fed, and supplied armies of the time, and its successful logistical program ensured
its superiority for many years.



#DESC_TECH_Artillery_Tactics
^
^
^By trade, Napoleon was an artillery officer, and he understood the devastating impact that a
well-placed artillery bombardment could have upon an enemy formation. Napoleon's tactic of a "grand
battery" called for hundreds of guns to be deployed on the battlefield, all lined up to fire [en masse]
on the advancing enemy force. The tactic often called for a concentration of fire upon a key spot in
the field, followed by a massing of troops to exploit that location once the enemy line fell apart.
In fact, the tactic was so popular that over 50 years later, at the battle of Gettysburg during the
American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee used the massed artillery formation to pound the Union
lines prior to Pickett's Charge.

Era were some of the most highly trained and mentally disciplined in the world. The French

#DESC_TECH_Code_Civil
^
^Before the Revolution, France was awash in legal inconsistencies. Hundreds of codes of law were
practiced: The northern part of the country practiced a form of Common Law, while the south practiced
Roman Law. When Napoleon came to power, he quickly moved to consolidate and codify these laws, and by
1804, the consolidation was ratified and put into practice.
^
^The Code Napoleon (later renamed to [Civil Code]), was a mix of liberal and conservative philosophy,
in which many basic rights guaranteed before the Revolution �- civil equality, freedom of religion and
the abolition of feudalism �- were retained. The Code also guaranteed property rights and reinforced
patriarchal power by giving full household authority to the husband. After Napoleon's fall in 1815,
the Code was retained almost in its entirety by the Bourbons and is, to this day, the [modus operandi]
for many legal systems throughout the world. 


#DESC_TECH_General_Education
^
^
^A good educational system was very important to Napoleon. Prior to the French Revolution, the
school systems of Europe (and of France in particular) could be seen as desperately lacking.
Poor schools, poorly trained teachers, lack of discipline... all of these traits defined the
educational system that Napoleon inherited from his predecessors. Shortly after his ascendancy to
the throne, the Little Emperor moved to improve the education in France. If France were to rise out
of its Revolution and become the greatest European power, its citizenry needed knowledge.


#DESC_TECH_Seapower
^
^
^British Admiral Horatio Nelson once said, "No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship
alongside that of the enemy." While the French army under Napoleon swept across Europe, the
British Royal Navy dominated the seas. The Napoleonic Era can also be seen as the Age of Sail.
Mighty Ships-of-the-Line answered broadside with broadside, and glorious battles were fought
between massive armadas to determine the fate of Europe.


#DESC_TECH_Naval_Tactics
^
^
^The Napoleonic period was a time when rival European fleets, typically consisting of
large numbers of wooden-hulled frigates and ships of the line, vied for naval supremacy.
As these deadly contests at sea took place, naval tactics continued to evolve. One of the
most decisive maneuvers that a fleet tried to execute was to "Cross the T", done when
one long "battle line" of ships managed to attain a perpendicular aspect to the enemy
fleet, thereby bringing the firepower of all their ships to bear in raking volleys up
and down the line of the ill-positioned foe.
^
^By the end of the Napoleonic period the British navy emerged strong and triumphant --
the supreme naval power of the world, due in no small part to the genius of Admiral Horatio
Nelson, whose name still today is synonymous with the British Navy.

kingdom was ripe for change. King and queen fled the French Revolutionary army but later returned to
power under the aid of the British and Lord Nelson. But the fate of the kingdom ultimately rested in
the hands of the little emperor, and in 1806, the French once again drove the Bourbons out of Naples.
In their place, Napoleon throned his brother Joseph Bonaparte, who himself was later replaced by Joachim
Murat. But, as was typical of the politics of the time, Murat himself was executed by the resurgent
Ferdinand, who merged both Naples and Sicily together, and crowned himself Ferdinand I (King of the Two
Sicilies).

^
^The rise of Prussia as a European power during the 18th century took many by surprise. Under the noble
statesmanship of the �Great Elector� Frederick William, and military headsman Frederick the Great, Prussia
expanded its holdings to include not only Berlin and a province east of Danzig, but Silesia which it wrested
from Austria; Pomerania from the Swedes; and a choice strip of land from the Poles that connected East Prussia
to Brandenburg. They also acquired Cleves-Geldres of the lower Rhine, Emden, Mark, and two duchies in southern
Germany. Yet, despite these territorial gains, Prussia remained a relatively poor nation, whose resources were primarily dedicated to the betterment of its army. 
^
^    During the French Revolution, Prussia tried to remain noncommittal. But by 1806, having lost much of its
territories to a relentless Napoleon and his unwavering Imperial Guard, Prussia entered the Fourth Coalition
and never looked back. Some badly needed military reforms helped bolster its power, and in 1815, the new
Prussian army (under the enigmatic leadership of Gebhard von Blucher) helped the British bring a final
end to Napoleon�s reign.

^
^Indo-European, Ural-Altaic, and other races have occupied what is now the territory of Russia since 2000 BC, 
but little is known about their institutions and activities. Modern Russia dates from about 770, when Viking 
explorers began an intensive penetration of the Volga region. From bases in estuaries along the eastern Baltic, 
Scandinavian bands, probably in search of new trade routes to the east, began to penetrate territory populated 
by Finnish and Slavic tribes, where they found unlimited natural resources.
^    Within a few decades the Rus, as the Viking settlers were known, together with other Scandinavians operating 
farther west, extended their raiding activities down the main river routes toward Baghdad and Constantinople, 
reaching the Black Sea in 860. In the period from 930 to 1000, the region came under complete control by the Rus 
from their capital at Novgorod.
^    The lifeblood of this sprawling Kievan empire was the commerce organized by these Viking princes. Novgorod's 
burghers even forged an accommodation with the invading Mongols during the 13th century, but its absorption by the 
growing Slavic principality of Muscovy in 1478 ended its political independence.
^    Ivan III (1462-1505) consolidated the gains his father, Vasily II, had won in the saddle. This "gathering of 
the Russian lands" became a conscious and irresistible five-century drive by Moscow to annex all Slavic lands, both 
the Russian territories and the Belorussian and Ukrainian regions. The ascension of Peter I (the Great; 1694-1725) 
ushered in and established the social, political and intellectual trends that were to dominate Russia for the next 
two centuries. The location of his capital, St. Petersburg, on the shores of the Gulf of Finland symbolized this 
shift toward a European involvement. 
^    {Catherine the Great} (1762-1796) would prove to be Peter's true intellectual and political heir. Catherine's 
reign was notable for imperial expansion. Most important were the securing of the northern shore of the Black Sea, 
the annexation of the Crimea, and the expansion into the steppes beyond the Urals. This permitted the protection of

^agricultural settlements in the south and the establishment of trade routes through the Black Sea. In the 
process, the military democracies of the {Cossack} hosts along the Dnieper, Don and Volga rivers lost their autonomy 
and special privileges; the wealthier officers became Russian nobles, receiving the right to own and settle serfs on 
their own lands, while the fierce horsemen sank to the level of peasants with special military obligations.
^    Despite the heritage of Peter and Catherine, by the time of Nicholas II (1894-1917) Russia was in disarray, 
fighting an onerous war and plagued by internal misery and oppression. The Kerensky provisional government, a 
moderate attempt to resolve the problems, collapsed in the face of the Bolshevik revolution. Given the Bolshevik 
desire to dominate the whole of Russia and the rest of the former tsarist empire, civil war was inevitable. Stalin 
would complete the consolidation of Communist power begun by Lenin. And he would lead Soviet Russia through the 
greatest threat to its existence, and help it emerge as one of the world's superpowers following the Second World War. 
^    But in the ensuing Cold War, Russia's economy tottered towards collapse. The people turned to Boris Yeltsin, 
a liberal Party functionary. Elections to the Congress of People's Deputies in March 1989 saw him score a stunning 
victory. He used his newfound legitimacy to promote Russian sovereignty, to advocate and adopt radical economic reform, 
to demand Gorbachev's resignation, and to negotiate treaties with the Baltic republics, in which he acknowledged their 
right to secede from the union. An ill-conceived, ill-planned, and poorly executed coup attempt to unseat Yeltsin 
occurred August 1991, bringing an end to the Communist Party and accelerating the movement to disband the Soviet 
Union. Yeltsin dissolved the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in December 1991, banned the Communist Party in 
Russia and seized all of its property.

^Modern France has its roots in ancient Gaul. In the 2nd century BC Rome intervened on the side of Massilia (Marseilles), 
a Greek colony founded in 600 BC, in its struggle against the barbarian tribes of the hinterland. The result was the 
formation, in 121 BC, of the Roman Provincia; between 58 to 50 BC Caesar seized the remainder. From 395 the internal 
problems of the Empire encouraged barbarian penetration of 
Transalpine Gaul. By 418, the Franks and Burgundians were established west of the Rhine, and the Visigoths had settled 
in Aquitaine. The period of the Merovingian and Carolingian Frankish dynasties (476-887) frames the Early Middle Ages. 
^    Following his ascension, the first Merovingian, Clovis (481-511), consolidated the position of the Franks in northern 
Gaul. Clovis came to believe that his victories were due to the Christian God. Clovis' subsequent conversion assured 
the Frankish rulers of the support not only of the Catholic Church but of the majority of their own subjects. By the 
rise of the house of Valois in 1328, France was the most powerful kingdom in Europe. Its ruler could muster larger 
armies than rivals; he could tap enormous fiscal resources; and the king's courts maintained royal supremacy. The 
history of France in the Late Middle Ages is dominated by efforts of its kings to maintain their suzerainty, efforts 
that, despite French advantages, were long frustrated. 
^    The Hundred Years War was an intermittent struggle between 
England and France in the 14th-15th centuries over a series of dynastic disputes, including the legitimate succession 
to the French crown. The war's turning point was reached in 1429, when an English army was forced to raise its siege 
of Orl�ans by a relief force organized by {Joan of Arc}. Her insistence that only consecration at Reims could make a 
true king, chosen by God, led to further victories. Charles III was anointed in Reims in July 1429. By 1453, England 
retained only Calais, which it finally relinquished in 1558.
^    With the ascension of the infant Louis XIII (1610-1643), the security of the country was again threatened as factions 
disputed the throne. Crown and country, however, were rescued by the most controversial 
#DESC_RACE_FRENCH
^
^
^figure of the Bourbon dynasty: 
Armand-Jean du Plessis, Cardinal de Richelieu. He proved an 
indefatigable servant of the French crown, intent on securing absolute obedience to the monarchy and on raising 
its international prestige through the military prowess of the King�s elite {Musketeers}. Under the last Bourbons, 
France became the industrial and commercial center of Europe.
^    These developments, although significant by themselves, 
gave rise to a still more momentous change: the French Enlightenment, a cultural transformation based on rationalism, 
empiricism, and an amorphous concept of freedom found in the influential writings of Rousseau (1712-78). Hence, what 
began in 1787 as a conflict between royal authority and aristocrats became a triangular struggle, with "the masses" 
opposing both absolutism and privilege. By any standard, the fall of the Bastille to the Parisian crowd was a monumental 
event, a seemingly miraculous triumph of the people. But the Revolution soon degenerated in a reign of terror and chaos. 
Unlike others before him, Napoleon terminated the bloodshed, but at the price of suppressing freedom altogether. 
In utter contrast to the Revolution, militarism became the defining quality of the Napoleonic regime. However, the 
revolutionary fervor of the French citizenry was undiminished by the Napoleonic experience, and led to further 
revolutions in 1830 and 1848, the latter leading to the Second Republic followed by the Second Empire (1852-1870). 
^    Following defeat in the Franco-Prussia War, the Third Republic was formed - surviving the First World War but 
collapsing in the face of the German invasion in 1940. The period of the short-lived Fourth Republic (1947-59) 
was succeeded by the Fifth, adopted in September 1958 by popular referendum.

^In Roman times Britain lay on the periphery of the civilized world, and it emerged into the light of history 
only after the Saxon settlements in the 5th century AD. Tribal migrations into Britain began about the middle 
of the 5th century. The first arrivals were invited by a British chieftain to defend his kingdom against the Picts 
and Scots. The first mercenaries were from three tribes - the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes - which located on the 
coastlands of northwestern Germany. Eventually, these peoples would themselves topple the native kingdoms. But 
unity was fleeting; the subsequent Norman Conquest (1066) resulted in the subordination of England to a Frankish 
aristocracy, and the introduction of feudalism to the Isles.
^    The English Normans would eventually give rise to a 
purely British line of kings, the Plantagenets. Three centuries later, the Wars of the Roses was the final struggle 
between the Yorkist and Lancastrian descendants of the Plantagenets for control of the throne. When Henry Tudor, earl 
of Richmond, seized the crown in 1485, leaving the Yorkist Richard III dead upon the field of battle, few Englishmen 
would have predicted that 118 years of Tudor rule had begun. {Elizabeth} I (1558-1603) proved to be the most able Tudor 
monarch. No observer in 1558, any more than in 1485, would have predicted 
that despite the social discord, political floundering, and international humiliation of the past decades, the kingdom 
again stood on the threshold of an extraordinary age. Her reign ushered in two centuries of British exploration, 
colonization, artistic and intellectual advances. When Elizabeth, the "Virgin Queen," died childless, Parliament 
offered the crown to the closest blood kin, James VI of Scotland (1603-1625) and the United Kingdom was born, 
defended by the "wooden wall" of the Royal Navy�s {Men-o-War}. 
^    Every major war Britain engaged in during this period increased its colonial power. The Seven Years' War 
was particularly notable in this respect, and so were the Napoleonic Wars. By 1820 the total population  
of the British Empire was 200 million, 26% of the world's total population. However acquired, all these
acquisitions added to

^the crown�s and the country's power and reputation. For the privileged and the rich,
the Victorian era was pre-eminently one of confidenceand arrogance, under the able
guidance of Britain�s two Prime Ministers, Gladstone and Disraeli. But the "long summer
of peace" came to an end in the bloodbath of Flanders. 
^    Although Britain suffered far less physical damage than France and underwent no political revolution, World War 
I may have affected it more fundamentally than any other European power. The war was a catalyst for social and 
economic change. The mainstays of the Industrial Revolution, such as coal mining, textile production, and 
shipbuilding, upon which British prosperity had been built, were now impoverished or redundant. British 
foreign policy for much of the postwar period aimed at rehabilitating Germany, while domestic policy focused 
on institutionalizing socialism to counter public concerns. In general, these movements were opposed by France 
and resulted in a rupture between Britain and its wartime ally, forcing France into a position of isolation that 
would have prodigious consequences for Europe with the rise of Hitler in the 1930s. Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) 
set out to end socialism in Britain. Her most dramatic acts consisted of a continuing series of statutes to 
denationalize nearly every industry that Labour had brought into public ownership during the previous 40 years. 
Promising that "we shall govern as New Labour," the Blair government installed in general elections in 1997 accepted 
some of Thatcher's foreign policies but also carried out the economic reforms it promised in its manifesto. 
In retrospect, the 1990s were a period of transition, controversy and continuity in the United Kingdom, and for the 
royal family... Europe�s oldest surviving monarchy.

^
^The Kingdom of Spain is located in the extreme southwest of the European continent, and occupies approximately 85-percent 
of the Iberian Peninsula. Spain is bordered on the west by Portugal, in the Northeast by France, and by the great wall of the 
Pyrenees Mountains.  The Iberian Peninsula that the Spanish inhabited was occupied by various other civilizations, including 
the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, and Muslims, and Spain is now associated with having a very rich, eclectic 
culture as a result.
^    The development of Christian society and culture in the first 300 years following Islamic conquest in Spain was slow, but 
major changes occurred for the Spanish in the 12th and 13th centuries. The population grew, communication with northern 
Europe intensified, commerce and urban life gained in importance, and the kingdoms of the Castile, Aragon, and Navarre, and 
Portugal emerged as the governing bodies of the Iberian Peninsula. These kingdoms reached the frontiers that they would keep, 
with minimum amount of alteration, until the end of the Middle Ages, when {Isabella I} became Queen of Castile.
^    Isabella began participating in the royal court at the age of 13; and when Portugal, Aragon, and France offered their 
marriage candidates, she favored Ferdinand of Aragon. Isabella ascended to the throne as Queen of Castile to rule sensibly 
and with a prudent political program.  Her unification of the states of the Iberian Peninsula into a single entity, the 
maintenance and control over the Strait of Gibraltar, policy of expansion into Muslim North Africa, reform of Spanish 
Catholicism, and support for the exploration and expansion in the unknown was evidence of her wisdom and capabilities as 
Queen.
^    On October 12, 1492 Columbus, with the blessing and financial backing of Isabella, sought a route to the legendary rich 
markets of China and Japan, but instead discovered what would become known as "The New World", the present day Americas.  This 
voyage gave way to a new golden age of expeditions and conquest, as the Americas contained gold, a valuable resource that Spain 
happened to be desperately bereft of at the time.

#DESC_RACE_Spanish
^
^
^
^Following Columbus' lead, a Spanish military group known as Los Conquistadores, 'The Conquerors', were directed by Hernan 
Cortes to the New World with the sole purpose of seeking out new frontiers and riches in the unknown.  The Conquistadores 
undertook their expeditions in the vast landmasses of the Americas at their own expense, risking their lives without aid from 
the Spanish royalty.  Their conquests included campaigns in Guatemala, Peru, Cuzco, Columbia, Chile, the Bay of Honduras, and 
as far as the Pacific Coastal regions.  The Conquistadors, however, were given to fighting and searching for gold, and were 
swiftly replaced by administrators and settlers from Spain who governed in their place.
^    Once the Spanish Kingdom established its presence in the Americas their operations inevitably became high-profile targets 
of pirates and other raiders who were endorsed by European powers such as England.  The Monarchy of Spain endeavored to 
retaliate by building an armada of warships that was dubbed "The Invincible Armada". The armada was a collection of over 130 
naval warships and transport-ships, which contained approximately 8,000 seamen and 19,000 soldiers. King Philip II directed 
this armada to invade England when the various and frequent raids on Spanish commerce in the Caribbean became intolerable.  
England's success in repelling the Spanish fleet saved England and the Netherlands from potential consolidation into the 
Spanish empire, but despite the armadas' defeat, the blow dealt by the Spanish upon England's reputation as the greatest 
European power was palpable.
^    Thereafter, Spain declined in power quickly; and by the 19th century, Spain became somewhat marginal in international 
politics. Spain's period of imperial power and exploration left a legacy that consisted of 18 Latin American states, Puerto 
Rico, and the ever-growing Spanish-speaking population in the United States today. In 1975 Spain transitioned into a 
constitutional monarchy by way of a democratic constitution and is now recognized for its eclectic culture as well as for 
the glory and mystique that it once possessed in its youth.

^
^In the 18th century, Scandinavia was divided into two states, the most important of which,
Sweden, included Finland. Possession of Finland brought forth the ire of Russia, who did not like
the presence of a foreign power so close to her capital of St. Petersburg. As Russia "coveted"
Finland, Prussia wanted Swedish Pomerania. And in turn Sweden itself wanted Norway (which, at the
time, was linked by a common crown to Denmark).
^
^    During the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden stayed neutral for as long as it could. But by 1805, it had
joined the Third Coalition. As fate would have it, however, due to various military and political
turmoils (as outlined above), one of Napoleon�s henchmen, French Marshal Bernadotte, found himself
accepting the role of Crown Prince of Sweden. This pleased Napoleon greatly, thinking he now had an
ally on the throne. But duplicity was the game of choice for Bernadotte. Fully disenchanted with
the little Emperor by this time, Bernadotte publicly supported Napoleon, while at the same time he
secretly helped the Allies in their efforts to crush France.

British-Swedish alliance on the other. When she was not willing to submit to British demands to
stop �calling� at French ports, the British shelled Copenhagen in 1801 and again in 1807. These
attacks led to Denmark�s (rather forced) alliance with Napoleon, and as the Little General finally
succumbed to the Fates, so too Denmark. By 1814, its majestic city shelled, its fleet besieged,
and its economy weakened, Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden and Helgoland to England.

^
^Fables and legends that feature the origins of the Ottoman Empire indicate that {Osman}, a Turkish tribesman, 
was the original ruler responsible for founding the civilization that nearly brought Christian Europe to its 
knees. Narratives indicate that Osman's tribe, the Kayi, fled west from the Mongols in the 13th century and took 
control of a freebooting army of nomads and Muslim peasants who inhabited the rugged stretch of wasteland along 
the Byzantine frontier.  This band of refugees enjoyed close ties to Muslim guilds and religious brotherhoods in 
local towns that were led by Sheikh Edebali, who allowed Osman to form a tiny state around his castle of 
Karacahisar.  Turkish warriors and religious leaders who also fled from the pagan Mongols in the east quickly 
populated this region, ruled by Osman.  Osman directed his community through the Kara Su valley to seize 
Yenisehir, and establish it as the first true Ottoman capital. The Ottoman state emerged, poised above the 
fertile shores of the Sea of Marmara.
^    Osman continued to wage a slow but persistent war against the Byzantine Empire who endeavored to defend 
their territories along the Asiatic shores that were opposite of Constantinople (now Istanbul).  His first 
victory over a Byzantine army at Koyunhisar in 1301 AD perpetuated Osman's fame, and settlers flocked to Ottoman 
territory as a result.  Osman extended his control over several other Byzantine fortresses, providing the 
Ottomans with strong bases from which they could lay siege to Bursa and Nicaea in northwest Anatolia.  The 
pinnacle of Osman's reign occurred at the conquest of Bursa shortly before his death.
^    Initially, Ottoman war tactics were no different than those used by the tribal Turks.  They would first 
harass the foe with horse-archers, employing hit and run tactics, only closing in on the enemy when they became 
completely disorganized.  Thus, the earliest Ottoman successes were won against isolated Byzantine garrisons, 
but rarely against a field army.  In order to capture fortified towns the Ottomans ravaged the countryside and 
imposed blockades.  Afterwards, the Ottomans would revive the town's trade and increase its population   
#DESC_RACE_Ottomans
^
^
^so that it could then be consolidated into the Empire as a productive and functioning
city. During their earliest exploits, the Ottomans were frequently frustrated by
fortifications and the exhausting sieges that were required in order to overcome these
defenders. This changed in the 15th century and beyond as imported expertise in firearms
and gunpowder led to some of the most massive artillery of 
the time. A form of Turkish heavy cavalry, known as {Sipahi}, became the predominating military unit utilized by 
the Ottoman Empire. The earliest variations of these soldiers were well-armored men on well-armored horses, 
who typically used a mace as their primary weapon.  During the 17th century the Sipahi replaced their archaic 
weaponry with sabers and pistols, establishing them as a fearsome presence on the battlefield.  While European 
infantry were more than a match for the standard Ottoman infantry, the Sipahi were far superior to any 
medieval knights.
^    During their period of expansion, the Ottomans visualized Europe as Americans would later see their Western 
frontier: a land of destiny. The conquest of Istanbul in 1453 AD initiated this by uniting Muslim Anatolia and
Christian Rumelia under the Ottoman Sultan's protection. However, this attitude would change as the Ottomans 
were forced to go on the defensive during the 17th and 18th centuries. Ottoman defeats were followed by mass 
slaughters of Muslim minorities. These massacres characterized the war between Christian and Turk in the 19th 
century.
^    At its height, the Ottoman Empire territory included Hungary, Serbia, Bosnia, Romania, Greece, the 
Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, Israel, Egypt, a large section of North Africa, and most of the Arabian Peninsula. Over 
time, however, Sultans grew weary of their administrative duties and withdrew from public affairs. The office of 
Grand Vizier was created to act second only to the sultan in authority and revenue, but while the Grand Vizier 
was able to stand in for the sultan in an official capacity, he could not take his place as a focus of loyalty 
among the different classes and social groups in the empire.  This separation of political loyalty and 
centralized authority led to a decline in the government's ability to impose its will, which inevitably led to 
the Ottoman Empire's end in 1922, when it was replaced by the Turkish Republic.

^
^Austria, located in lower Central Europe north of the Balkans, first coalesced as a nation in the early Middle
Ages by the margrave Leopold of Babenberg, a regional noble who in the 10th century C.E. pushed the Magyars from
that area and formalized a system of common law. But it was not until three hundred years later that Austria would
take the first steps towards great power status.  A Hungarian noble, Otakar II, took advantage of a succession
dispute in 1254 and married into the Babenberg line.  As a response, the German nobility in Bavaria and elsewhere
felt concerned, and began a long campaign to undermine and eventually depose Otakar.  The German army's commander,
a relatively obscure noble from a minor family, was then elected king of Germany to reward his successes. His name
was Rudolf of Hapsburg.  The Hapsburgs would become one of Europe's most powerful families; the seat of their power
was Austria.
^    In 1519 Martin Luther posted his famous 95 Theses, and at the time the Hapsburg emperor was {Charles V}, a devout
Catholic and harsh ruler. Forced to rule two essentially foreign countries -- Austria and Spain -- Charles did his best, but
made many mistakes and alienated many nobles before he was able to successfully ride two of Europe's strongest horses
at once. Moreover, Charles' fervent opposition to Protestantism as well as his well-founded concerns regarding the
Hapsburg rights in western Europe diverted his attention from the threat of the Ottoman Turks (whose ships already
ruled the Mediterranean). He used severe measures to put down rebellions in lower Austria and in the Netherlands, and even
allowed an unpaid and hungry army to sack Rome over a grudge against the Pope. Nonetheless, Charles dealt successfully
with a huge number of threats, minor and major, to the Austrian empire, and he also managed to keep the Turks at bay. He even managed to expand the empire, by acquiring the Portuguese succession rights. His greatest ambition, to
bring all Protestants back into the Church, was obviously a failure, although he made several sincere (and even nonviolent)
attempts to bring this about.
^    After Charles' death, the empire steadily grew, adding Bohemia to the northeast.  The new Emperor, Ferdinand, wished
to extend his 
#DESC_RACE_Austria
^
^
^influence and rule further into Germany. The result was the Thirty Years' War, in which the great powers of Europe took
advantage of religious strife to expand their influence.  Austria did not do well in the end, and lost territory and huge
amounts of money in the war and ensuing treaty.
^    Austria continued to play a major role in European and world politics through the nineteenth century, attempting to slow
the rise of Prussia in Germany, and acting as a key member of the coalition opposing Napoleon.  The Austrian army adopted
the style and dress of the Hungarian light cavalry, and these fast, deadly horsemen came to be known as {hussars}. Hussars
quickly became part of virtually every European army's order of battle, and some still fight today.
^    Since 1700 Austria has been (and remains) a focal point of European culture and learning.  History's greatest composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, created his works for the Austrian emperor.  The Vienna Circle, an influential group of philosophers
and mathematicians, sparked the "logical positivist" movement, which sought to unify philosophy with natural science. At the
same time, the economist Carl Menger founded the Austrian school of economics, which emphasized qualitative analysis of
human action.
^    The first among many of the twentieth century's tragedies began in Austria, with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
by Serbian nationalists.  When the Serbian government refused Austria's outrageous demands, Austria declared war on Serbia. This
sparked the chain of events leading to World War I, which would consume millions of lives and leave Europe's great empires in
ruins and revolution. The Hapsburg empire was no exception, and its final collapse came at this time.
^    After World War I, Central Europe was broken into many different countries.  Austria was ruled by a series of authoritarian
regimes until it was annexed by one even more
 so -- Hitler's Germany.  After a period of military rule, Austria became a
full-fledged republic in 1955. Today Austria is known as a repository of European culture and tradition, despite its struggles
with its Nazi past; its churches and universities are among Europe's most prestigious, especially in the arts.

^
^
^In 1139 CE, Afonse Henriques, appointed count of the province of Portugal by the king of Castile, defeated a
Muslim army at Ourique. Impolitely, he took that opportunity to declare Portugal independent of Castile, with
himself as king of the new country. He was able to get away with it largely due to the recognition by the
Christian kingdoms of Spain that the Muslims were the common enemy, and when assured that Portugal would still play
an active role in the impending Reconquista, Castile-Navarre and Aragon were willing to overlook Henriques�
impudence. Two hundred years later, once the Muslims were confined to their tiny corner of Spain in Granada,
Castile saw fit to repossess the Portuguese kingdom. When the Castilian army was soundly thrashed in battle by
the warrior king John of Aviz, it was clear to all that Portugal was there to stay.
^    After the victory over Castile and the collective reconquest of Iberia from the Muslims, Portugal looked
overseas to continue its expansion. King John led a campaign against Ceuta in North Africa (modern-day Morocco).
The ease of Ceuta�s conquest caught the attention of his third son, {Prince Henry the Navigator}. Henry�s
older brother Duarte succeeded to the throne after John�s death, and the two were often at odds, with Duarte
skeptical and suspicious of Henry�s ambitions to explore new lands and convert the natives to Christianity. For
the next twenty years Henry sponsored expeditions to western Africa, and even led a campaign to invade Tangiers
in 1437 (which ended in defeat). But on the whole Henry�s personal seafaring experience was limited; his
sobriquet comes from his patronage of other adventurers and the resulting age of discovery and colonization that
they inaugurated with his support.
^    Portuguese explorers continued their discoveries after Henry�s death in 1460. The greatest was Bartolomeu
Dias, whose 1488 voyage around the southern coast of Africa made Europe aware of the Indian Ocean and a shorter
route to India than the one Columbus gambled on just four years later. Dias also traveled across the western
Atlantic to Brazil; on that voyage he was lost at sea in 1498. 
^    Closely following Dias was Vasco da Gama, who took Dias� maps
#DESC_RACE_PORTUGAL
^and went beyond their limits, landing in India in 1497. He made three trips to India over the following thirty
years, the last of which took place in 1524 after his appointment by the King as viceroy of India. He did not
live long after his arrival; some speculate he was poisoned by corrupt administrators who feared punishment at
his hands.
^    In 1543, Portuguese sailors were shipwrecked in Japan. They did not stay long, but left behind the technique
of musket-making -- in that way, a handful of men changed Japanese history forever, as the samurai era was drowned
by the sound of musketfire. By that time Portugal�s overseas holdings were vast, comprising holdings all over
Africa, India, China, Macao, and South America.
^    In 1580 Spain awoke, flexing its muscles as the world�s pre-eminent power. It took the opportunity to
occupy Portugal, and for almost 100 years the two countries were united. The Portuguese royalty did not give
up, though, and through clever diplomacy and alliance with England they were able to restore their monarchy and,
with Spain greatly weakened and demoralized by the Thirty Years� War, finally forced Spanish recognition of
Portuguese independence. Portugal remained an influential and wealthy European power through the Napoleonic Wars,
when its alliance with Britain gave the British a foothold on the Continent to oppose Napoleon�s armies.
^    Portugal�s prosperity lasted until the 1890s, when a combination of inflation and sluggish
industrialization undermined its industries. Dissatisfaction with the monarchy led to a coup and the establishment
of a republic in 1910; this did not last long, as radical groups pursued extreme agendas and unrest grew. In 1926,
the army bloodlessly overthrew the republic; the junta asked a university professor and occasional member
of parliament named Antonio Oliviera de Salazar to assume control of all economic policy. Six years later,
Salazar became prime minister, a limited office in theory but dictator in practice. Salazar�s new
constitution formalized his powers and he ruled Portugal with absolute authority for nearly 40 years.
^    In 1968 Salazar suffered a stroke; his ministers tried to continue the dictatorship but in 1974 a
democratic revolution re-installed a republican form of government. After narrowly avoiding a Communist coup,
Portugal flourished, although it presently faces structural problems similar to those of its nearest
European neighbors.

^Toward the end of the 16th century CE, the independent cities and principalities of Flanders and Belgium sent
representatives to Utrecht to form an alliance. The alliance would coordinate taxation and military operations
against Spain, whose ruling Hapsburgs had dominion over the Low Countries even after they adopted the Protestant
religion. The Netherlands, comparatively small and poor compared to mighty Spain and its empire of gold in
the Americas, often had to rely on {Swiss mercenaries} and other hired guns for its defense. This was not a
long-term solution, hence the need for a much closer alliance. The result of this meeting was the Union of
Utrecht, which formally created the United Provinces of the Netherlands.
^    Spain, which had spent the previous decade alternately fighting and politicking against the armies and
intrigues of {William of Orange}, was not pleased by this development. Orange�s position had always been that
Spain�s sovereignty over the Netherlands was legitimate, but the governors chosen by the King were trampling
the rights of Orange and the other native nobles. William also vehemently opposed the imposition of Catholicism
on his homeland, but still felt the King of Spain could be persuaded to loosen his grip. This proved unrealistic,
and in 1581 Orange publicly renounced his loyalty to the Spanish throne. He was assassinated a few years later;
he did not live to see his country completely free of Spanish domination.
^    However, once the provincial leaders (particularly those of Holland, the largest and most influential of
the United Provinces) and the nobles began to cooperate, putting their disagreements to one side, Spain was
nearly defeated. Under the brilliant political, military, and economic leadership of Johan de Witt, perhaps
the Netherlands� greatest statesman, the Dutch Republic grew into a world power, its rapidly growing economy and
naval presence allowing it to settle colonies around the world and establish a massive trade empire. This
wealth translated into a cultural golden age lasting over a hundred years.
^    During that time, Dutch thinkers made fundamental contributions to philosophy, law, science, and art.
Hugo Grotius, a lawyer and
#DESC_RACE_NETHERLANDS
^philosopher, wrote �On the Law of War and Peace� in 1625 �- perhaps the first comprehensive analysis of
international law. The philosopher Baruch Spinoza published substantial revisions of his mentor Rene
Descartes� rationalist works, and also wrote a lengthy defense of freedom of conscience �- which was promptly
denounced as heresy by his contemporaries. In art, an obscure portrait painter named Rembrandt van Rijn rose
to prominence (and disapproval) for his religious paintings and figure studies. Peter Paul Rubens, a great painter
in his own right, also ran an immense school for artists, attracting dozens of talented painters from all over
Europe to the Netherlands. The mathematician Christiaan Huygens developed his wave theory of light, which was a
giant leap in the study of optics pioneered by Isaac Newton. And biology was made incomparably easier by Antonie
van Leeuwenhoek�s invention of the microscope.
^    After the Golden Age, the Netherlands retreated into the background, as the English fleet gradually achieved
its supremacy. By the Napoleonic era, the Netherlands was once again dominated by its neighbors. In 1830,
Belgium broke away from the United Provinces, in reaction to the restoration of the monarchy and the subordination
of the Estates General, the council of stadtholders (provincial rulers). The Industrial Revolution came to
the Netherlands as it did to the rest of continental Europe, and when World War I arrived, the Dutch remained
neutral.
^    The Dutch were not so fortunate during World War II, as Hitler�s armies invaded and imposed their brutish
rule. (The diary of Anne Frank, a Jewish girl living in Amsterdam, is considered a classic portrait of innocence
confronted with great evil.) Despite an unusually active and vigorous resistance to the Nazis �- which was often
met with brutal reprisals �- a great many Dutch Jews died in the Nazi death camps. After the war, the former
Dutch colonies followed the pattern of other European colonies at the time, with independence and nationalist
movements breaking out everywhere. Dutch politics were still characterized by religious divisions even until
the 1970s, appropriately given the nation�s history, but a more conventional parliamentary party system arose.
Today the Netherlands, a thoroughly modern European nation, is best known for its hosting of international
institutions such as the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
